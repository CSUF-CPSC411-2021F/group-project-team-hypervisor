## Overview
### Summary
MealPickr is an mobile android application that helps those who cannot find a place to eat. 
It will take the user’s current location and pick a random restaurant within a range (mi) the user chooses. 
Ex. If the user lives 1 mile away from a McDonalds and the user chooses 2 miles as the range, 
McDonalds will have a possible chance of being selected. There will be different filters you can 
choose whether you feel it’d be a meal, dessert, what restaurant is open, or even a type of meal.

### Platforms
For now this application is meant to be supported on Android

## Background and motivation
It's always hard choosing a place to eat around the area. 
There are times where it takes over 30 minutes just thinking of what to eat. 
For those indecisive folks, it would be nice to have a generator to select random restaurants to eat. 
It can also help give ideas by having the application choose random restaurants for you. 
I feel like it is universal because everyone has to eat. Time is important so don’t waste time 
thinking when you should be eating.


## Features

## Progress
### Check-in 1
#### Developer 1 Farnam:
Simply added a MenuItem class, created a branch and pushed my code. 

#### Todo list:
1. Get started on searching different API's to see the different types of data that we need to deal with
to then hard code the data. 

#### Developer 2 Vincent:
Added information to the design document and pushed a RandomGenerator branch.

#### Todo list:
1. Figure out how to capture data from the API and think of any more classes we need.

#### Developer 3 name:
Describe the changes made to your code since the last check-in. List any issues you encountered while you were building your application and solutions if you already solved them. Document any design changes or modifications in the features of your project and provide the reasons behind the change. 

#### Todo list:
1. Describe what you plan to accomplish by the next code checkin. You can check the milestone list for reference.

### Check-in 2:
Follow the same format as Check-in 1.
